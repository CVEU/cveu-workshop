                This workshop is for the 1st installment of the AI for Creative Video Editing and Understanding (CVEU).
                The workshop brings together researchers working on computer vision, machine listening, computer
                graphics, Human Computer Interaction, and cognitive research. It aims to bring awareness of recent
                advances in machine learning technologies to enable assisted creative-video creation and understanding.
                The workshop will include invited talks by experts in the area and give the community opportunities to
                share their work via oral and poster presentations. We encourage practitioners, designers, students,
                post-docs, and researchers to submit work describing new ideas, work-in-progress, and previously or
                concurrently published research. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
